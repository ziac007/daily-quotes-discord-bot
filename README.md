## 🚀 Instructions for Deployment on Render
The root folder contains a version of the bot with a minimal Flask server to keep the app alive on free Render instances.
1. 🌐 Push Code to GitHub
2. ⚙️ Setup Environment Variables
    - In the Render dashboard:
    - Add a new 'Web Service'
    - Use your 'GitHub repo'
    - Set Environment Variables:
      - `TOKEN:` your Discord bot token
      - `CHANNEL_ID:` your Discord channel ID
3. 🔧 Configure Build & Start
    - Build Command
        `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    - Start Command:
       `gunicorn dailyquote:app --bind 0.0.0.0:8080`
4. 🟢 Prevent Idle Shutdowns (Optional but recommended)
    - Render's free tier spins down after inactivity.
    - To keep the bot alive: 
      - Use [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/)
      - Add your Render URL as an HTTP monitor
      - Set it to ping every 5 minutes


<br>

## 📌 Deployment Notes
- ✅ Successfully deployed on **Render's free tier instance**
- ✅ Tested for **24 hours continuously** with **UptimeRobot** pinging every **5 seconds** to prevent idle shutdown
- ✅ On **paid Render instances**, Flask keep-alive is **not needed** — the bot runs continuously without any downtime

## ⚠️ Known Issue: Warning Message in Render Logs
When the bot is deployed, you may see the following warning in the logs:

WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.

This can be safely ignored if you’re running the bot for personal/non-production use with gunicorn.
